As a full-service payroll company, it offers automatic deductions, remittances, and filings of federal, state, and local taxes. It can even handle minimum wage adjustments for tip credits and child support payments in 49 states (all but South Carolina). In contrast, many standalone payroll solutions for small businesses require you to process garnishments and local taxes manually.

//             <p className="text-black">
//               Even if it has started offering global hiring and payroll services, Gusto is not the most scalable solution in the market. Enterprise businesses, for example, will have difficulty finding crucial pay data insights, such as pay disparities and compensation benchmarks. This is because Gusto has limited report customization capabilities and completely lacks data visualization. Instead, you’ll need to export the reports to a spreadsheet program to create customized charts and gain data insights. </p>
//             <p className="text-black">
//              Gusto also becomes tedious to use once you have more than 50 employees. Unless you upgrade to a higher tier, it still requires some manual data inputs for things like time tracking and new hire onboarding.  </p>

//             <p className="text-black mb-4">
//              Gusto’s payroll module features a progress bar with steps and instructions at the top so you stay on track and remember what information you need for payroll finalization. If you don’t enable Gusto’s AutoPilot function, running payroll takes only three steps: enter employee earnings and actual work hours, input time off details, and review and submit.  </p>
            
//             <p className="text-black mb-4">
//              If you don’t have a native or integrated time-tracking module, Gusto makes the process somewhat less tedious than Rippling, which previously held the top spot in this list. This is because Gusto includes fields to adjust employees’ hours, earnings, deductions, and reimbursements on the same page. You only have to open the section to adjust the fields that apply to each employee. </p>
           
//             <p className="text-black mb-4">
//               This is unlike Rippling, which separates hourly and salaried employees into different steps and puts each employee’s earnings and deductions in tabs. You will need to switch tabs and do long, horizontal scrolls to find and adjust the pay codes that apply to each employee. As a result, Rippling requires significantly more clicks to finish payroll than Gusto.</p>

It can help you save money with R&D tax credits or start a pay-as-you-go workers’ compensation policy through its partner, NEXT Insurance.

However, its features aren’t extensive—you can’t attribute codes, like utilities, to payments for accounting purposes or send transactions to stakeholders for approval. You also can’t filter or export bill payment data to your accounting application. Nevertheless, if you’re switching to Gusto after doing accounting and payroll processes yourself, it is a step up from manually maintaining billing and vendor profiles.</p> </>

//               OnPay is not the best choice if you expect to need more robust payroll features later. It supports unlimited and multi-state payroll but lacks global payroll functionality. OnPay may flag you of payroll errors as you process employee payments, but lacks in-app compliance checkers, so you’ll have to become familiar with new laws on minimum wages, PTO, and overtime in each state where your employees reside before running payroll. </p>

OnPay’s tax filing service is also a bit better than QuickBooks Payroll because it covers federal, state, and local taxes; whereas QuickBooks Payroll will require you to upgrade to either its Premium and Elite plans if you want it to file local tax forms for you.

//             As a small-business accounting giant, Intuit’s QuickBooks is highly likely one of the first software products you purchase alongside a payroll solution. If you get both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Payroll, you can manage accounting and payroll data from the same app so you can see a single view of your business’s cash flow. Running payroll in QuickBooks is also relatively easy. It automatically populates earnings for your salaried employees, but you’ll have to manually enter regular and overtime hours for your non-exempt hourly staff. However, upgrading to its higher subscription tiers grants you access to its native time and scheduling capabilities.</p>
//             <p className="text-black">
//              In addition to attendance monitoring and staff scheduling, you get geolocation, geofencing, and mobile time clock tools. This is helpful if you employ mostly field workers without a central base of operations. Plus, as you progress subscription tiers, you access additional project tracking features.  By comparison, Paycor and Gusto are the only alternatives on my list that offers equivalent time tracking and scheduling support—although Paycor’s are add-on modules while Gusto’s scheduling tools are limited.</p>

It doesn’t support third-party integration options for strategic HR functions, such as recruitment and performance management.

//             <p className="text-black mb-4">
//              If you bundle your QuickBooks Payroll subscription with QuickBooks Online, you can run payroll and vendor bill payments from the same system. QuickBooks’ is significantly more advanced than Gusto’s bill pay option. In addition to creating a list of vendors and paying them directly from the platform, it lets you set up multi-conditional approval workflows and log bills by categories to assist with expense management. This is great if you’re managing bills from multiple work locations and need certain employees to confirm bill accuracy, such as when bills exceed a certain dollar threshold.</p>
            
//             <p className="text-black mb-4">
//              If you don’t have employees, QuickBooks offers a contractor payments option with accounting features. Besides being more affordable than Gusto’s contractor-only plan, it doesn’t restrict you from following typical employee payroll schedules. Instead, you can pay contractors per any pay agreement you make or alongside your regular billing cadences. This provides you more control over your company costs, allowing you to schedule payments during periods of higher revenue.</p>

//              Exporting payroll ledgers to your accounting program of choice can be tedious, especially if your payroll platform doesn’t integrate with your accounting program. However, when you use QuickBooks Payroll and QuickBooks Online together, the system automatically records applicable pay data in your chart of accounts once you finalize payroll. While it automatically assigns default accounts to map your payroll based on wages, expenses, and liabilities, you can modify these settings to your liking. </p>

You can even pay terminated employees without temporarily changing their employment status in the system.

Without a step-by-step guide, newbies are less likely to remember to add or adjust critical pay items.
