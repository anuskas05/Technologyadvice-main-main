                Rounding out the 4-star range on our list is NetSuite CRM from
                Oracle. If that name sounds familiar, it should: NetSuite was an
                internet pioneer back when the internet still ran on dial-up.
                These days, the brand (now owned by Oracle) continues to offer

                planning (ERP), accounting and financials, inventory tracking,
                and more. Organizations looking to use a single system to manage

                The overall design of Oracle NetSuite CRM also focuses on
                providing a comprehensive view of the customer lifecycle. While
                its interface and usability score moderately, the CRM’s strength
                lies in its ability to offer a 360-degree view of customers,
                integrating sales, customer service, and marketing effectively.

                more efficient and unified approach to managing various business

                        of the client depending on how many individuals will be

                      While there are certainly software solutions that are
                      objectively “bad,” the majority of options in any given
                      vertical will be valued by how well they satisfy the
                      intended use case. Trying to apply the tool outside the
                      parameters it was designed for may fail to meet
                      expectations, but that does not necessarily mean the
                      software itself is of poor quality. It’s just a bad match.

                      For CRM tools, the most foundational functionality is that
                      of collecting and organizing contact information. At the
                      very least, it needs to be a step up from simply dumping
                      leads into a spreadsheet only to immediately be forgotten.
                      Spreadsheets have their place, but they aren’t optimized
                      for automation or to serve as living records. If a CRM
                      can’t improve on manual data entry, manual data scrubbing,
                      and manual retrieval, then it’s just Excel with extra
                      steps.

                    By now, nearly everyone is familiar with the “This call may
                    be recorded for quality assurance purposes” line spoken to
                    customers calling in to a business for support. Having a
                    record of customer/client/lead interactions can be
                    indispensable. And not just for maintaining excellent
                    service, either.

                    Implementing new software systems can be difficult, and
                    onboarding users only becomes more problematic when the
                    system doesn’t play well with existing solutions in the
                    workflow. Some CRMs are built as part of a larger platform
                    of business solutions, and are intended to be used as a
                    holistic unit. This is a bit of a trade-off, and some
                    cost-benefit evaluations will be needed to determine if a
                    complete workflow overhaul will net positive or negative
                    returns for the trouble. However, if maintaining the
                    stability and functionality of other systems is of equal
                    importance, then finding a CRM software that can integrate
                    with them successfully. Depending on what integrations are
                    needed, there may be plug-ins or add-ons available already
                    to users of the tool.

                      After diving into the world of CRM solutions, you’ve
                      likely noticed there’s no shortage of options. This
                      abundance is actually a good thing – it means you have the
                      flexibility to find a CRM that fits your business like a
                      glove, whether you’re running a small startup or managing
                      a large company. If you’re a small business owner, you
                      might be looking for something straightforward and
                      budget-friendly. On the other hand, if you’re at the helm
                      of a larger company, you might need a CRM with all the
                      bells and whistles – think advanced features and seamless
                      integrations with your existing tech stack.
