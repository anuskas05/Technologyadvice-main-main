                overlapping responsibilities or within integrated workflows.

                As part of the Atlassian ecosystem, Jira can integrate with
                other Atlassian products like Confluence, Bitbucket, and Trello.
                After setting up their Confluence accounts, Agile teams can
                directly link project documentation, requirements, and decision
                records to Jira issues and sprints. Additionally, by integrating
                with Atlassian’s control system, Agile teams can link commits,
                branches, and pull requests to Jira issues.
              </p>

              <p className="text-black mb-4">
                In addition to integrating within the Atlassian ecosystem, Jira
                can also integrate with other tools outside this suite. These
                include software development tools, communication platforms,
                tracking apps, and customer relationship management (CRM)
                systems.

                If you manage software development teams or organizations

                ClickUp is a cloud-based project management software initially
                developed as a team management platform. After further software
                development, ClickUp now offers features that enhance work and
                task management, making it a sound choice for streamlining
                workflows. With its highly customizable user interface (UI),

                ClickUp’s native time tracking, which is available on all paid
                plans, helps teams monitor time spent on specific tasks. While
                monday.com offers native time tracking with basic
                functionalities, ClickUp’s time tracking is configurable and
                offers advanced capabilities. It allows users to manually input
                time entries and create custom statuses, workflows, and
                time-tracking settings specific to their project needs.
              </p>
              <p className="text-black mb-4">
                This feature is helpful for companies that need to keep track of
                billable hours. Some examples include creative agencies,
                software development teams, and legal services. Native time
                tracking also enhances resource management by helping you
                accurately allocate resources and monitor ongoing tasks in real
                time.

                ClickUp offers reporting features that are well-suited to many

                reports based on project progress, team performance, and
                resource allocation. After you generate these reports, ClickUp
                can export them in PDF, CSV, and Excel formats. Combining this
                functionality with its native time-tracking feature gives
                ClickUp an edge in demonstrating distinction over its

                      Scheduling a project involves constructing a project
                      timeline, delegating tasks, and outlining the known
                      checkpoints within the project. Project management
                      software includes different types of scheduling features
                      that give teams alternative ways to visualize their
                      projects. While some project management tools use a
                      traditional calendar view, more complex solutions like
                      Gantt charts and horizontal project timelines help teams
                      break large or complicated projects into manageable tasks.
                      Scheduling features in a project management tool will help
                      your team go from a mind map to a project plan quickly by
                      giving insight into both time and resource management.

                    Forecasting features in PM tools use data from previous
                    projects to predict the time and resource management
                    considerations the team will need to complete the project.
                    This project manager software feature helps project managers
                    calculate the ROI of a project before significant resources
                    have been invested. Forecasting takes into account the time
                    spent on each task and the resources required to complete
                    each task relative to the organization’s budget constraints
                    and revenue goals. A forecasting tool can also predict
                    project risks and limitations that might potentially pose
                    issues down the line.

                    Similar to forecasting, resource management features in
                    project management software help project managers visualize
                    where their business invests time, energy, and materials so
                    the business can assess or change their plan when unforeseen
                    challenges arise. It can be time-consuming to enter and set
                    up a detailed inventory of company and human resources, but
                    doing so allows project managers to anticipate bottlenecks
