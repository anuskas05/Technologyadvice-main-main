          <>
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
             Gusto started as an employee and contractor payments company but now supports various HR functions like benefits administration, performance management, recruitment, and global payroll. As a full-service payroll company, it offers automatic deductions, remittances, and filings of federal, state, and local taxes. It can even handle minimum wage adjustments for tip credits and child support payments in 49 states (all but South Carolina). In contrast, many standalone payroll solutions for small businesses require you to process garnishments and local taxes manually. 
            </p>
            <p className="text-black">
              Gusto also supports global businesses with contractor payments in more than 120 countries. For its Gusto Global product, it partnered with Remote to offer EOR services for employers needing to hire and pay workers 
            </p>
           
            <p className="text-black">
             While the coverage may be limited as of this writing, Gusto plans to expand its EOR services to other countries soon.</p>

              Gusto limitations
            </h4>
            <p className="text-black">
              Even if it has started offering global hiring and payroll services, Gusto is not the most scalable solution in the market. Enterprise businesses, for example, will have difficulty finding crucial pay data insights, such as pay disparities and compensation benchmarks. This is because Gusto has limited report customization capabilities and completely lacks data visualization. Instead, you’ll need to export the reports to a spreadsheet program to create customized charts and gain data insights. </p>
            <p className="text-black">
             Gusto also becomes tedious to use once you have more than 50 employees. Unless you upgrade to a higher tier, it still requires some manual data inputs for things like time tracking and new hire onboarding.  </p>
          </>
        ),
        "Key Features": (
          <>
            <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">
              Simple payroll interface
            </h4>
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
             Gusto’s payroll module features a progress bar with steps and instructions at the top so you stay on track and remember what information you need for payroll finalization. If you don’t enable Gusto’s AutoPilot function, running payroll takes only three steps: enter employee earnings and actual work hours, input time off details, and review and submit.  </p>
            
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
             If you don’t have a native or integrated time-tracking module, Gusto makes the process somewhat less tedious than Rippling, which previously held the top spot in this list. This is because Gusto includes fields to adjust employees’ hours, earnings, deductions, and reimbursements on the same page. You only have to open the section to adjust the fields that apply to each employee. </p>
           
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
              This is unlike Rippling, which separates hourly and salaried employees into different steps and puts each employee’s earnings and deductions in tabs. You will need to switch tabs and do long, horizontal scrolls to find and adjust the pay codes that apply to each employee. As a result, Rippling requires significantly more clicks to finish payroll than Gusto.</p>
            <h4 className="text-lg font-bold mb-2">
             Payroll add-ons
            </h4>
            <p className="text-black">
             Gusto offers several add-on features that benefit small businesses. It can help you save money with R&D tax credits or start a pay-as-you-go workers’ compensation policy through its partner, NEXT Insurance. If you sign up for its state tax registration add-on, Gusto will file and monitor all the paperwork needed to expand your business into new states. </p>
         
         <p className="text-black">
             Further, Gusto has a free bill pay module. It allows you to create an electronic roster of all your vendors, upload bills from suppliers and subcontractors, and schedule payments. However, its features aren’t extensive—you can’t attribute codes, like utilities, to payments for accounting purposes or send transactions to stakeholders for approval. You also can’t filter or export bill payment data to your accounting application. Nevertheless, if you’re switching to Gusto after doing accounting and payroll processes yourself, it is a step up from manually maintaining billing and vendor profiles.</p> </>

             Gusto’s pricing starts at $49 monthly plus $6 per employee, per month (PEPM). You can choose between three tiers: Simple, Plus, and Premium. Similar to QuickBooks Payroll, Gusto also offers a contractor-only payroll plan for $35 per month plus $6 per contractor per month*. However, it isn’t as affordable as QuickBooks Payroll, which only costs $15 monthly for up to 20 workers plus $2 for each additional contractor.</p>

             OnPay’s specialty may be payroll, but it has all the features you need to manage small business HR processes, such as time off management, benefits administration, task management, and customizable onboarding workflows. These all come standard with OnPay, unlike the other providers on my list that require you to purchase a higher subscription to get some of these features. </p>
            <p className="text-black">
             OnPay may not have automatic pay run features, but its interface is straightforward, requiring just as many (or fewer) clicks as Gusto to complete payroll. Like Gusto, OnPay lets you add or adjust earnings and deductions on the same screen, avoiding extra clicks and cumbersome spreadsheets. You can also adjust specific employee pay information in a sidebar window without leaving the workflow. </p>
          <p className="text-black mb-4">
             While it doesn’t offer a contractor-only plan like QuickBooks Payroll and Gusto, OnPay allows you to pay contractors within the same pay cycle as your regular employees. This avoids repeating the payroll process for your different worker classifications at the end of every pay period.</p>

         <p className="text-black mb-4">
              OnPay is not the best choice if you expect to need more robust payroll features later. It supports unlimited and multi-state payroll but lacks global payroll functionality. OnPay may flag you of payroll errors as you process employee payments, but lacks in-app compliance checkers, so you’ll have to become familiar with new laws on minimum wages, PTO, and overtime in each state where your employees reside before running payroll. </p>
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
              One of the biggest drawbacks, especially for businesses with mostly non-exempt hourly workers, is OnPay’s lack of native time-tracking or scheduling features. It does integrate with popular options like When I Work and Deputy, but QuickBooks Payroll may be a better choice if you want easy data transfers from time tracking to payroll.  </p>

            <p className="text-black mb-4">
             OnPay offers basic staff engagement and recordkeeping features that you rarely see in standalone payroll platforms, such as employee profile bios and customizable fun fact questions. Workers can view this information and work contact numbers directly in OnPay. This is useful if you have shift workers who need to reach team members to report emergencies like tardies or other shift changes. </p>
            
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
             You can use its customizable forms to create documents for tracking business and staff information, such as collecting employee T-shirt sizes for an upcoming work event or tracking company equipment like computers and keys. Its e-signature capabilities also allow you to collect essential documents and obtain legal acknowledgments from employees. For instance, employees can electronically sign uniform deduction agreements to deduct the cost from their next paychecks. </p>
            
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
             You can even create similar flows for handbook policies, including any that impact payroll processes, such as employee bonuses, reimbursements, and other deductions. Gusto may have similar functionalities but reserves it for its higher-paying plans. </p>

             You can save custom reports and views to access the data you need as it changes with each pay run. I was also impressed with OnPay’s report designer, which lets you filter and drag-and-drop report columns to adjust your view in real time without downloading data to a spreadsheet program of choice. This saves you time from downloading reports repeatedly. In contrast, Gusto only lets you choose the columns or data fields you want. You can’t rearrange the order without running the report and selecting the columns again. If you want an easier way of viewing and filtering data fields for your reports, use OnPay.</p>

              OnPay’s feature is comparable to Gusto’s least expensive Simple plan, but OnPay has a slightly lower monthly base software fee ($40 vs $49) and surpasses Gusto Simple’s capabilities. It includes multi-state payroll—a feature that Gusto offers in its Plus and Premium tiers. OnPay’s tax filing service is also a bit better than QuickBooks Payroll because it covers federal, state, and local taxes; whereas QuickBooks Payroll will require you to upgrade to either its Premium and Elite plans if you want it to file local tax forms for you. With its competitive one-price-fits-all model, it’s a better choice for small establishments without major growth goals. However, if you have plans to grow, consider Paycor—its all-in-one platform can handle basic to advanced payroll and HR processes.</p>

            <p className="text-black mb-4">
            As a small-business accounting giant, Intuit’s QuickBooks is highly likely one of the first software products you purchase alongside a payroll solution. If you get both QuickBooks Online and QuickBooks Payroll, you can manage accounting and payroll data from the same app so you can see a single view of your business’s cash flow. Running payroll in QuickBooks is also relatively easy. It automatically populates earnings for your salaried employees, but you’ll have to manually enter regular and overtime hours for your non-exempt hourly staff. However, upgrading to its higher subscription tiers grants you access to its native time and scheduling capabilities.</p>
            <p className="text-black">
             In addition to attendance monitoring and staff scheduling, you get geolocation, geofencing, and mobile time clock tools. This is helpful if you employ mostly field workers without a central base of operations. Plus, as you progress subscription tiers, you access additional project tracking features.  By comparison, Paycor and Gusto are the only alternatives on my list that offers equivalent time tracking and scheduling support—although Paycor’s are add-on modules while Gusto’s scheduling tools are limited.</p>

              QuickBooks Payroll is ideal to use if you’re a QuickBooks user or only need a standalone payroll option for your small business. It doesn’t support third-party integration options for strategic HR functions, such as recruitment and performance management. It also lacks an organizational chart and customized onboarding workflows. </p>

            </h4>
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
             If you bundle your QuickBooks Payroll subscription with QuickBooks Online, you can run payroll and vendor bill payments from the same system. QuickBooks’ is significantly more advanced than Gusto’s bill pay option. In addition to creating a list of vendors and paying them directly from the platform, it lets you set up multi-conditional approval workflows and log bills by categories to assist with expense management. This is great if you’re managing bills from multiple work locations and need certain employees to confirm bill accuracy, such as when bills exceed a certain dollar threshold.</p>
            
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
             If you don’t have employees, QuickBooks offers a contractor payments option with accounting features. Besides being more affordable than Gusto’s contractor-only plan, it doesn’t restrict you from following typical employee payroll schedules. Instead, you can pay contractors per any pay agreement you make or alongside your regular billing cadences. This provides you more control over your company costs, allowing you to schedule payments during periods of higher revenue.</p>

            <p className="text-black">
             Exporting payroll ledgers to your accounting program of choice can be tedious, especially if your payroll platform doesn’t integrate with your accounting program. However, when you use QuickBooks Payroll and QuickBooks Online together, the system automatically records applicable pay data in your chart of accounts once you finalize payroll. While it automatically assigns default accounts to map your payroll based on wages, expenses, and liabilities, you can modify these settings to your liking. </p>
            <p className="text-black">
             For example, you may use a particular account to monitor your contribution to payroll taxes outside of a general expense account. Besides helping you understand your tax liabilities, you can also use it to determine some of the costs associated with hiring a new employee for recruitment and headcount planning purposes.</p>

              Unlike the other payroll processing software on my list, it offers an affordable contractor-only plan and an option to get 50% off monthly base fees for your first three months* with QuickBooks Payroll.

For example, unlike Patriot Payroll and QuickBooks Payroll, Paycor has a full-scale recruiting module that leverages artificial intelligence (AI) HR tools to source top prospects and engage passive candidates. Other features like compensation planning, pulse surveys, and career management support your long-term talent needs and align them with your company’s objectives and costs.`,

            Paycor is an all-in-one human resources management system (HRMS) that offers modules for critical HR functions like payroll as well as auxiliary processes like learning and development. This versatility makes Paycor best suited for growing and established companies that need direct control over their payroll processes in a unified HR tech stack. </p>
            <p className="text-black">
             It lets you add or modify existing payroll schedules as needed, and the system will automatically make the necessary adjustments. It has a customizable pay grid organized by rows of employees, which lets you add and remove columns for information like bonuses and commissions to fit your needs. You can even pay terminated employees without temporarily changing their employment status in the system. This is great if there was an error in the employee’s previous payroll and you need to pay them an adjustment after they’ve separated from the company.</p>
          <p className="text-black">
             There are also buttons to automatically adjust an employee’s gross pay so the net pay is a specified amount, like in the case of bonus checks. Plus, Paycor has alerts for shortfalls, no pay, earnings, and hours based on your company’s needs.</p>

         <p className="text-black mb-4">
              Paycor’s pay grid setup may increase payroll efficiency for large teams, but it can be overwhelming for small businesses and startups that need dedicated support. Without a step-by-step guide, newbies are less likely to remember to add or adjust critical pay items. Gusto, for instance, has a separate step just for keying PTO hours—a crucial data point that’s easy to miss if you’re managing payroll on top of multiple other HR functions.</p>
             <p className="text-black mb-4">
              Paycor also doesn’t support payroll outside of the U.S., so it’s a better option for domestic businesses with seasoned HR or payroll specialists that need flexibility over their pay processes.</p>

             Paycor lets you pay employees through direct deposits, paycards, or checks. It also offers on-demand pay, allowing employees to access up to 50% of their wages before payday through its mobile app. Free budgeting, financial counseling, and learning resources for employees also compete with the financial wellness resources offered by Gusto.</p>
            
            <p className="text-black mb-4">
            Another great feature is Paycor’s check-stuffing services to pay your unbanked employees.

Doughnut charts allow you to see the breakdown of employer and employee tax liabilities, while a series of quick links lets you download popular reports, like your payroll journal. It even pre-populates employee pay stubs up to three days before paydays, enabling your workers to check their expected payouts and report pay errors.</p>
            <p className="text-black">
            Paycor also has a report builder to craft customized reports from scratch. You can work off pre-existing reports by adding, renaming, or creating new columns for analysis. Many of the payroll reports also come with visualizations, like total compensation by month and department, to understand changes in labor costs without switching to your accounting software.</p>
           <p className="text-black">
            Further, Paycor’s analytics module includes an AI digital assistant to ask questions and receive answers about your employee data in natural language.

If you have a limited budget and prefer to handle tax filings yourself, its basic plan only costs $17 per month plus $4 PEPM. It has all the features included in the full-service option but without tax filing services.`,

Its platform has a simple but intuitive interface that helps streamline processes, making it easy for small businesses to learn and use its various features. With its payroll module, you get unlimited pay runs with automatic federal, state, and local tax deductions and filings—provided you sign up for its full-service plan.

             If you have a multi-location business, you can assign employees to a primary work location in the system, which also includes a work-from-home option. Patriot Payroll will then calculate the applicable payroll taxes based on the employee’s work location. Plus, you don’t need to manually search for workers assigned to specific business sites when running payroll. Patriot Patriot has a filter option that lets you choose the work location, allowing you to process and review payroll only for specific teams.</p>

         <p className="text-black mb-4">
             Patriot Payroll may support unlimited pay runs for US-based workers, but it lacks Gusto’s global payment tools. Its contractor-only package also does not compete well with QuickBooks Payroll, which only costs $15 monthly for up to 20 workers; whereas Patriot charges $17 per month plus $4 PEPM if you’re on its basic plan. Plus, Patriot collects add-on fees for time tracking and multi-state payroll tax filings. And even if you get the HRIS add on, the features are very limited. This is unlike Gusto and OnPay, which include basic hiring tools and automated onboarding flows in their starter tiers. </p>

             While you can get two-day direct deposits with Patriot Payroll, it only offers this to qualified customers.

This is unlike the other providers in this guide that don’t have qualifying assessments for two-day direct deposits. However, if you require fast payouts to expedite payroll processing times and don’t need a wide range of HR tools, consider QuickBooks Payroll as it offers a next-day option in its basic plan. </p>

             While it may be easy to notify employees that they are eligible for a specific bonus, you have to constantly remind them that the amount they see may be subject to tax. Typically, workers find it difficult to determine the applicable payroll tax deductions—intead, they prefer knowing the take-home bonus amount they stand to get. With Patriot’s net to gross payroll tool, you don’t need to do manual calculations to figure this out. You simply input the bonus amount you want employees to receive and the system will automatically gross it up for taxes. This helps you save time and ensures payroll compliance.</p>

Once you exceed 10 workers, you can switch to its Full-service package, where Patriot will handle tax remittances and filings for you. </p>

If you’re familiar with using pay processing tools, you can follow its online wizard to create your Patriot Payroll account and complete setup requirements. If you need help, it also offers free payroll setup assistance. You only need to provide the necessary company and employee information and Patriot will handle the setup process for you.

      question: "How does payroll software work?",

        "Payroll software simplifies pay processing tasks, such as calculating paychecks, adding employees to the company payroll, maintaining payroll records, and ensuring compliance. The way it works may vary depending on how software providers design their systems, but the standard process includes inputting employee information, pay rates, and attendance or hours worked. The system takes this data to compute, deduct withholdings, support direct deposits, and enable the entire payroll process.You can also link modern payroll software to bank accounts for automatic salary disbursement. Payroll solutions also generate pay slips to show pay information and create relevant payroll and tax reports.",

It streamlines payroll processes, decreases payroll and accounting staff labor, drives efficiency, and saves your HR team from doing repetitive administrative work. More importantly, it ensures accurate and timely wage payments, which is critical for employee satisfaction. Correct compensation is fundamental to the employee-employer relationship.Payroll systems also help you avoid or minimize compliance issues.

    Aside from ensuring that it has the pay processing features your business needs, you should consider the following factors when selecting payroll software:
  </p>

  <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
    <li>
      <b>Customer support:</b> You're trusting this company with your payroll and employee compensation. If support is hard to reach or unhelpful, that’s a red flag. Look for vendors with responsive customer service and check trusted review platforms like G2 or Capterra for user feedback.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Transparent pricing:</b> Make sure you understand how the provider charges—most payroll companies have a monthly base fee plus a per-employee rate, and may charge extra for services like tax filing, off-cycle payrolls, and time tracking. Always request a full quote from a sales rep to avoid surprises.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Free trial:</b> While not always available, a free trial can help you test the features and usability before committing. If one isn’t offered, ask for a live demo or temporary access so you can explore the platform hands-on.
    </li>
    <li>
      <b>Flexibility:</b> Every business is different. Look for a provider that doesn’t require long-term contracts and is willing to adapt to your specific needs. A flexible provider can scale with you and adjust if your situation changes.
    </li>
  </ul>

      question: "What are the essential features of payroll software?",
      answer:
        "While this can vary depending on your business requirements, I recommend looking for a payroll system that offers unlimited pay runs, automatic tax calculations, and tax payment/filing services. These features help save you time and money, while ensuring compliance with payroll tax regulations. It should also support multiple pay types and pay schedules, including direct deposit payouts so you can conveniently and securely send payments directly into your employees’ bank accounts. Finally, for easy employee data updates, it should have HRIS functionalities with onboarding and offboarding tools and an employee self-service portal where your team can access their pay stubs, tax forms, and other documents.",
    },
    {
      question: "How much does payroll cost for a small business?",
      answer: 
     "For a small business payroll software, monthly fees typically range from $40 to more than $60 for one employee. Note that this usually includes per-employee and base software fees. This can cost more, depending on the provider, your headcount, pay runs each month, and the features and services included, such multi-state payrol and tax reporting."
    ,
    },
    {
      question: "What is the most used payroll software?",
      answer:
        "Some of the most commonly used payroll systems are included in this guide, such as Gusto, which topped my list of the best small business software for payroll. QuickBooks Payroll is also a popular option, especially for small businesses that already use its accounting system.",

          To evaluate the best payroll software for small businesses, I collaborated with Irene Casucian, one of our expert research analysts, where we used a 52-point rubric to review and compare seven online payroll platforms. Our options included:
        </p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1">
          <li>Gusto</li>
          <li>Rippling</li>
          <li>Patriot Payroll</li>

          <li>Paycor</li>
          <li>RUN Powered by ADP</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          We looked for functionalities that streamline wage and tax calculations and automate payroll tax filings and payments. In addition to checking online user reviews, we researched the customization features, compliance tools, reporting, third-party software integrations, and customer support options offered. If available, we leveraged free trials and demos to assess each software’s functionality and ease of use.
        </p>

        <p>
          I also added my expert rating to each criterion, where I considered the effectiveness of that area or feature. Then, I narrowed down the list to my top five recommendations.
        </p>

        <p className="font-semibold text-base text-gray-900 mt-4">Below is the breakdown of the evaluation criteria:</p>

        <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
          <li>
            <b>Payroll features: 25%</b><br />
            We considered direct deposit timelines, automatic tax filings, contractor pay runs, garnishment payments, multiple employee pay options, and compliance. The top vendors automate most processes and offer coverage in all U.S. states.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Pricing: 20%</b><br />
            We rated transparent, affordable pricing, unlimited pay runs, free trials, and value-for-money. Platforms with better feature-to-price balance scored higher.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>HRIS features: 15%</b><br />
            Platforms with onboarding/offboarding, new hire reporting, employee portals, and recordkeeping earned higher marks. We also considered benefit access across all states.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Platform and interface: 15%</b><br />
            Usability, security, scalability, and tech stack integration were factored into this score.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Customer support: 10%</b><br />
            We reviewed support channels, availability, knowledge bases, and access to bookkeeping or payroll experts.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>Reporting and analytics: 10%</b><br />
            Strong compliance reporting, customizable templates, exports, and scheduled report features scored highest here.
          </li>
          <li>
            <b>User reviews: 5%</b><br />
            Ratings from Capterra, G2, and TrustRadius (3.5+ stars) contributed to this final category.

          My recommendations for the best payroll software for small companies are based on more than five years of experience writing about and evaluating payroll systems for small to mid-sized businesses (SMBs). I also have 10 years of expertise handling different facets of human resources, including managing HRIS, time tracking, and pay processing software.

                      Scheduling a project involves constructing a project
                      timeline, delegating tasks, and outlining the known
                      checkpoints within the project. Project management
                      software includes different types of scheduling features
                      that give teams alternative ways to visualize their
                      projects. While some project management tools use a
                      traditional calendar view, more complex solutions like
                      Gantt charts and horizontal project timelines help teams
                      break large or complicated projects into manageable tasks.
                      Scheduling features in a project management tool will help
                      your team go from a mind map to a project plan quickly by
                      giving insight into both time and resource management.
